## Install

Install via the Omarchy Package Repository via the `omawrite` package. It's installed by default in new installations of Omarchy (from Quattro forward).

## Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+S` saves. Unsaved documents use the XDG desktop portal file picker.
- `Ctrl+Shift+S` saves as.
- `Ctrl+O` opens a Markdown file through the portal picker.
- `Ctrl+P` opens the system print dialog.
- `Ctrl+N` opens a new Omawrite window.
- `Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+Shift+Z`, and `Ctrl+Y` handle undo and redo.
- `Super+F` toggles fullscreen. Qt maps this key as `Meta+F`.
- `Ctrl+F` searches the document. Use `Enter` or `Ctrl+G` for the next match and `Shift+Enter` for the previous match.
- `Ctrl+H` opens find and replace.
- `Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+I`, and `Ctrl+K` insert bold, italic, and link Markdown.
- `Ctrl++` and `Ctrl+-` adjust the editor text size. `Ctrl+=` also increases it,
  and `Ctrl+0` resets it to the original size.
- `Ctrl+?` shows the keyboard shortcut reference.

Unsaved drafts are recovered after an abnormal exit. Omawrite also watches open files
and warns before an external change can replace local work.

Text follows the desktop text size — `omarchy display text size`, or GNOME's
`text-scaling-factor` — and re-flows without a restart. The default of 12px leaves
Omawrite at the size it is designed around; larger and smaller sizes scale from there.
Editor text size starts at 20px, changes in 2px steps from 10px to 48px, and is
remembered across launches. Desktop text scaling is applied on top of this base size.

## Requirements

- Qt 6: `qt6-base`, `qt6-declarative`, `qt6-quickcontrols2`
- `xdg-desktop-portal` and a portal backend
