# Omawrite

A dead-simple Markdown writing app built with Qt Quick and C++ that automatically follows system dark/light mode.

## Install

Install via the Omarchy Package Repository via the `omawrite` package. It's installed by default in new installations of Omarchy (from Quattro forward).

## Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+S` saves. Unsaved documents use the XDG desktop portal file picker.
- `Ctrl+Shift+S` saves as.
- `Ctrl+O` opens a Markdown file through the portal picker.
- `Ctrl+P` opens the system print dialog.
- `Ctrl+N` opens a new Omawrite window.
- `Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+Shift+Z`, and `Ctrl+Y` handle undo and redo.
- `Super+F` toggles fullscreen. Qt maps this key as `Meta+F`.
- `Ctrl+F` searches the document. Use `Enter` or `Ctrl+G` for the next match and `Shift+Enter` for the previous match.
- `Ctrl+H` opens find and replace.
- `Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+I`, and `Ctrl+K` insert bold, italic, and link Markdown.
- `Ctrl+?` shows the keyboard shortcut reference.

## Math

LaTeX math renders in place, the way Obsidian's live preview does: `$...$` and
`\(...\)` inline, `$$...$$` as display math, and `\[...\]` as display math when
it stands on lines of its own (in prose, `\[` is an escaped bracket). Display
math on lines of its own may span several lines, up to a blank line. Put the caret in a
formula, by clicking it or moving onto it with the keyboard, to edit its source;
move away and it renders again. A formula MathJax cannot typeset keeps showing
its source in red. Dollar amounts like `$5 and $10`, code spans, and fenced code
stay text. Printing still shows the TeX source.

Unsaved drafts are recovered after an abnormal exit. Omawrite also watches open files
and warns before an external change can replace local work.

Text follows the desktop text size — `omarchy display text size`, or GNOME's
`text-scaling-factor` — and re-flows without a restart. The default of 12px leaves
Omawrite at the size it is designed around; larger and smaller sizes scale from there.

## Requirements

- Qt 6: `qt6-base`, `qt6-declarative`, `qt6-quickcontrols2`, `qt6-svg`
- `xdg-desktop-portal` and a portal backend
